## What is this project for
This project is being made for preparing myself to Java certification (1Z0-830) and can be used for other certification/study.

## How to use
Download all the files in a folder, then open index.html in your browser.
Because of CORS sometimes it can give some error, for this reason I add a link to Chrome (I don't have the parameters for Firefox but as soon I got it I will add it here) with this args:
--allow-file-access-from-files --disable-web-security --user-data-dir="[folder]"

Where [folder] is the location of the file.

If you want you can modify the json file adding more questions or fix some errors on these questions (I generated them using Deepseek and tried to fix the errors if presents).
